# Modules and Packages

In programming, a module is a piece of software that has a specific functionality. <br/>

For example, when building a ping pong game, one module would be responsible for the game logic, and another module would be responsible for drawing the game on the screen. Each module is a different file, which can be edited separately.

## Modules

Modules in Python are simply Python files with a .py extension. The name of the module will be the name of the file. A Python module can have a set of functions, classes or variables defined and implemented.

## Packages

Packages are namespaces which contain multiple packages and modules themselves. They are simply directories, but with a twist.<br/> <br/>

Each package in Python is a directory which MUST contain a special file called __init__.py. This file can be empty, and it indicates that the directory it contains is a Python package, so it can be imported the same way a module can be imported.
